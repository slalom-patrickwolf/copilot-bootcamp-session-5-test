# Step 5-0: Bootstrap Your Agentic Workflow System

## Goal

Before you can practice agentic development, you need to **bootstrap your workflow system** - the foundational infrastructure that enables AI to work autonomously. This step sets up memory, specialized modes, and automation tools that you'll use throughout Session 5.

Think of this as **setting up your development environment**, but for agentic AI:

1. **Memory System** - Configure persistent and working memory (already provided in `.github/memory/`)
2. **Project Instructions** - Connect AI to existing project documentation and workflow principles
3. **Specialized Chat Modes** - Create autonomous agents for TDD, code review, and workflow orchestration
4. **Prompt Files** - Build user-friendly slash commands that trigger complex workflows

By the end of this bootstrap step, you'll have a **complete agentic infrastructure** ready to use in Steps 5-1 through 5-5.

## Why Bootstrap First?

Earlier sessions taught you to provide context to AI through documentation. Session 5 teaches you to build **autonomous workflow systems** - but autonomous systems need infrastructure.

This bootstrap step creates:

- **Memory System**: Where AI stores and retrieves knowledge
  - **Persistent Memory**: Foundational principles that survive across all sessions
  - **Working Memory**: Session discoveries and patterns that evolve as you work
- **Specialized Agents**: Task-optimized modes that work autonomously within defined workflows
- **Orchestration Layer**: Higher-level coordination between specialized agents
- **User Interfaces**: Simple commands that trigger complex autonomous workflows

**Analogy**: Just like you need to install development tools (Node.js, npm, Git) before you can code, AI needs this infrastructure before it can work autonomously.

Once bootstrapped, Steps 5-1 through 5-5 will use this system to demonstrate **AI-assisted development at scale**.

## Instructions

### :keyboard: Activity: Launch Codespace

1. Click the below button to open the **Create Codespace** page in a new tab. Use the default configuration.

   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/{{full_repo_name}}?quickstart=1)

2. Confirm the **Repository** field is your copy of the exercise, then click the green **Create Codespace** button.

3. Wait for the Codespace to fully load (you'll see the workspace file tree).

4. **Complete Copilot Setup** (if prompted):
   - Click **"Finish Setup"** (bottom right)
   - Then click **"Set up Copilot"** to enable AI features
   - Wait for setup to complete before proceeding

5. **Wait for workspace initialization**:
   - Look for `npm install` running in the terminal (may happen automatically)
   - Wait until you see "Postinstall complete" or the terminal shows a prompt
   - This ensures the chat mode can properly detect the project model

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: If you switch to `copilot-customization` mode before npm install completes, the chat mode may not select the correct model. Wait for installation to finish first!

### :keyboard: Activity: Create Project Instructions File

Set up **project-level instructions** that give AI context about your codebase, workflows, and standards.

1. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** panel (icon in the upper navbar or `Ctrl+Alt+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`)

2. **Switch to the `copilot-customization` chat mode** (dropdown at top of chat panel)
   - Look for the dropdown menu at the top of the chat panel
   - Select `copilot-customization` from the list
   - üí° **About this mode**: `copilot-customization` is the **bootstrap mode** - pre-provided in this repository to help you create other modes!
   - This mode specializes in creating chat modes, prompt files, and instructions
   - You'll use it throughout this step to build your automation infrastructure
   - If you don't see chat modes, ensure you completed the Copilot setup in the previous step

3. Ask Copilot to create project instructions:

   ```text
   Create a .github/copilot-instructions.md file for this TODO application.

   Structure it with these sections:

   ## Project Context
   - Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend
   - Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development
   - Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion

   ## Documentation References
   Link to existing documentation (helps AI navigate the project):
   - docs/project-overview.md - Architecture, tech stack, and structure
   - docs/testing-guidelines.md - Test patterns and standards
   - docs/workflow-patterns.md - Development workflow guidance

   ## Development Principles
   - Test-Driven Development: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Incremental Changes: Small, testable modifications
   - Systematic Debugging: Use test failures as guides
   - Validation Before Commit: All tests pass, no lint errors

   ## Testing Scope
   This project uses unit tests and integration tests ONLY:
   - Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing
   - Frontend: React Testing Library for component unit/integration tests
   - Manual browser testing for full UI verification
   - DO NOT suggest or implement e2e test frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
   - DO NOT suggest browser automation tools
   - Reason: Keep lab focused on unit/integration tests without e2e complexity

   **Testing Approach by Context**:
   - Backend API changes: Write Jest tests FIRST, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
   - Frontend component features: Write React Testing Library tests FIRST for component behavior, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Follow with manual browser testing for full UI flows.
   - This is true TDD: Test first, then code to pass the test

   ## Workflow Patterns
   Describe the development workflows to follow:
   1. TDD Workflow: Write/fix tests ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Pass ‚Üí Refactor
   2. Code Quality Workflow: Run lint ‚Üí Categorize issues ‚Üí Fix systematically ‚Üí Re-validate
   3. Integration Workflow: Identify issue ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify end-to-end

   ## Chat Mode Usage
   Explain when to use each specialized mode:
   - tdd-developer: For test-related work and Red-Green-Refactor cycles
   - code-reviewer: For addressing lint errors and code quality improvements

   ## Workflow Utilities
   Explain GitHub CLI commands for workflow automation (available to all modes):
   - List open issues: gh issue list --state open
   - Get issue details: gh issue view <issue-number>
   - Get issue with comments: gh issue view <issue-number> --comments
   - The main exercise issue will have "Exercise:" in the title
   - Steps are posted as comments on the main issue
   - Use these commands when /execute-step or /validate-step prompts are invoked

   ## Git Workflow
   Explain conventional commit format and branch strategies:
   - Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, etc.
   - Feature branches: feature/<descriptive-name>
   - Always stage all changes before committing: git add .
   - Push to the correct branch: git push origin <branch-name>

   Format as clean markdown with clear headers.
   ```

4. Copilot will generate and create the file. **Review `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - this provides AI with foundational project context.

5. **Test it works**: Start a new chat, then ask "What workflow patterns should I follow?" - notice how AI knows the answer even in a fresh session!

### :keyboard: Activity: Create the Working Memory System

Now create the **working memory infrastructure** - where AI will track discoveries, patterns, and decisions during your development sessions.

1. **Use AI to create the memory system AND update project instructions**:

   In Copilot Chat (still in `copilot-customization` mode), ask:

   ```text
   Create a working memory system in .github/memory/ for tracking development discoveries, then update .github/copilot-instructions.md to reference it.

   PART 1: Create these files in .github/memory/:

   1. README.md - Explain the memory system:
      - Purpose: Track patterns, decisions, and lessons during development
      - Two types of memory: Persistent (.github/copilot-instructions.md) vs Working (.github/memory/)
      - Directory structure: session-notes.md (historical summaries), patterns-discovered.md (accumulated patterns), scratch/working-notes.md (active session)
      - When to use each file during TDD, linting, and debugging workflows
      - How AI reads and applies these patterns in future work
      - Explain the difference: session-notes.md is for completed session summaries (committed), scratch/working-notes.md is for active work (not committed)

   2. session-notes.md - Template for historical session summaries:
      - Purpose: Document completed sessions for future reference
      - Template with sections:
        * Session name and date
        * What was accomplished
        * Key findings and decisions
        * Outcomes
      - Include one example session summary
      - This file is committed to git as a historical record

   3. patterns-discovered.md - Template for documenting code patterns:
      - Pattern template (name, context, problem, solution, example, related files)
      - Include one example pattern: Service initialization (empty array vs null)
      - Accumulated learnings over time

   4. scratch/ directory - For active session work (not committed to git)
      - Create .gitignore file inside scratch/ that ignores all files: *
      - Create working-notes.md template for active session notes with sections:
        * Current Task
        * Approach
        * Key Findings
        * Decisions Made
        * Blockers
        * Next Steps
        * Notes
      - At end of session, summarize key findings into session-notes.md
      - This keeps active work ephemeral while preserving historical learnings

   PART 2: Update .github/copilot-instructions.md:

   Add a new "Memory System" section after the "Chat Mode Usage" section:

   ## Memory System
   - Persistent Memory: This file (.github/copilot-instructions.md) contains foundational principles and workflows
   - Working Memory: .github/memory/ directory contains discoveries and patterns
   - During active development, take notes in .github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md (not committed)
   - At end of session, summarize key findings into .github/memory/session-notes.md (committed)
   - Document recurring code patterns in .github/memory/patterns-discovered.md (committed)
   - Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions

   Make the README.md comprehensive and instructional - it teaches how to use the memory system!
   ```

2. Copilot will generate and create all the files, **and** update your project instructions. **Review `.github/memory/README.md`** to understand the memory system architecture.

3. **Understand your memory architecture**:

   | Type | File | Purpose | When to Use |
   |------|------|---------|-------------|
   | **Persistent** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Foundational principles | Created once, referenced always |
   | **Historical** | `.github/memory/session-notes.md` | Completed session summaries | After each session (committed) |
   | **Accumulated** | `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` | Code patterns learned over time | When pattern emerges (committed) |
   | **Active** | `.github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md` | Current session work | During active development (not committed) |

4. **Verify the bootstrap**:

   Start a new chat, then ask:

   ```text
   Explain the memory system in .github/memory/ and how I should use it during TDD workflows
   ```

   AI should describe the files you just created - this confirms the bootstrap worked!

5. **Key insight - The Learning Loop**:
   - **Persistent memory** (copilot-instructions.md) provides foundational knowledge
   - **Active memory** (scratch/working-notes.md) captures real-time session work (ephemeral)
   - **Historical memory** (session-notes.md) documents completed sessions (committed)
   - **Accumulated patterns** (patterns-discovered.md) preserves learnings over time (committed)
   - AI reads all committed files and applies learnings to future work
   - **Result**: The system learns and improves as you work through Steps 5-1 to 5-5

**You've now built the memory infrastructure!** In later steps, you'll actively capture discoveries in these files.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create TDD Developer Chat Mode

Now create a specialized mode for test-driven development workflows.

1. In the same **Copilot Chat** (still using `copilot-customization` mode)

2. Ask Copilot to create the TDD mode:

   ```text
   Create a custom Copilot chat mode for Test-Driven Development workflows.

   The mode should handle TWO TDD scenarios:

   **Scenario 1: Implementing New Features (PRIMARY WORKFLOW - ALWAYS Write Tests First)**
   - **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS start by writing tests BEFORE any implementation code
   - Write tests that describe the desired behavior (RED phase - test fails)
   - Run tests to verify they fail for the right reason
   - Explain what the test verifies and why it fails
   - Implement MINIMAL code to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
   - Run tests to verify they pass
   - Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
   - **Never implement features without writing tests first - this is the core TDD principle**

   **Scenario 2: Fixing Failing Tests (Tests Already Exist)**
   - Analyze existing test failures and understand root causes
   - Explain what the test expects and why it's failing
   - Suggest minimal code changes to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
   - Refactor after tests pass (REFACTOR phase)
   - Run tests to verify the fix

   **General TDD Principles (Both Scenarios)**
   - **PRIMARY RULE**: Test first, code second - never reverse this order for new features
   - Guide through complete Red-Green-Refactor cycles systematically
   - Break solutions into small, incremental changes
   - Encourage running tests after each change
   - Remind to refactor after tests pass
   - Focus on unit tests and integration tests (not e2e/browser automation)
   - **Default assumption**: When implementing new features, ALWAYS write the test first
   - When automated tests aren't available (rare case), apply TDD thinking:
     * Plan expected behavior first (like writing a test)
     * Implement incrementally
     * Verify manually in browser after each change
     * Refactor and verify again

   **IMPORTANT Testing Constraints**
   - NEVER suggest installing Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, or other e2e frameworks
   - NEVER suggest browser automation tools
   - Use existing test infrastructure: Jest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
   - For full UI flows, recommend manual browser testing
   - Keep testing simple and focused on TDD principles
   - **TDD Workflow**: Write tests FIRST (RED), implement to pass (GREEN), then refactor (REFACTOR)
   - **Backend changes**: Write Jest + Supertest tests FIRST, then implement
   - **Frontend changes**: Write React Testing Library tests FIRST for component behavior (rendering, user interactions, conditional logic), then implement. Always recommend manual browser testing for complete UI flows.

   Available tools: codebase, search, problems, editFiles, runCommands, getTerminalOutput, testFailure

   Preferred model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview) (copilot)

   Format as a .chatmode.md file ready to save in .github/chatmodes/
   ```

3. Copilot will generate and create the file at `.github/chatmodes/tdd-developer.chatmode.md`. The mode will be available immediately in the chat mode dropdown.

   > üí° **Quality Check**: The GitHub Actions workflow for Step 5-1 will automatically validate that this file exists before allowing you to proceed. No manual verification needed!

### :keyboard: Activity: Create Code Reviewer Chat Mode

Create a specialized mode for code quality and linting workflows.

1. In the same **Copilot Chat** (still using `copilot-customization` mode)

2. Ask Copilot to create the Code Reviewer mode:

   ```text
   Create a custom Copilot chat mode for systematic code review and quality improvement.

   The mode should:
   - Analyze ESLint/compilation errors systematically
   - Categorize similar issues for efficient batch fixing
   - Suggest idiomatic JavaScript/React patterns
   - Explain rationale for code quality rules
   - Recommend fixes that maintain test coverage
   - Identify code smells and anti-patterns
   - Guide toward clean, maintainable code

   Available tools: codebase, search, problems, editFiles, runCommands, getTerminalOutput

   Preferred model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Preview) (copilot)

   Format as a .chatmode.md file ready to save in .github/chatmodes/
   ```

3. Copilot will generate and create the file at `.github/chatmodes/code-reviewer.chatmode.md`. The mode will be available immediately in the chat mode dropdown.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create Workflow Prompt Files

Now create three **slash commands** that will use the gh CLI and Git knowledge from your project instructions.

1. In the same **Copilot Chat** (still using `copilot-customization` mode)

2. Ask Copilot to create the three prompt files:

   ```text
   Create three prompt files for workflow automation. These prompts will inherit gh CLI and Git knowledge from .github/copilot-instructions.md:

   1. execute-step.prompt.md
      - Description: "Execute instructions from the current GitHub Issue step"
      - Mode: tdd-developer (AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES to tdd-developer mode)
      - Collects input: issue-number (optional)
      - Instructions:
        * If issue number not provided, use gh CLI to find the exercise issue (see Workflow Utilities in project instructions)
        * Get the issue content with comments
        * Parse the latest step instructions from the issue
        * Execute each :keyboard: Activity: section systematically
        * DO NOT commit or push changes - that's the job of /commit-and-push
        * Stop after completing activities and inform user to run /validate-step
        * IMPORTANT: Follow testing scope constraints from project instructions - NO e2e frameworks
      - Tools: codebase, search, problems, editFiles, runCommands, getTerminalOutput, testFailure

   2. commit-and-push.prompt.md
      - Description: "Analyze changes, generate commit message, and push to feature branch"
      - Mode: NO MODE SPECIFIED (uses current active mode)
      - Collects input: branch-name (REQUIRED)
      - If no branch name is provided, ask the user for it
      - Instructions:
        * Analyze changes using git diff
        * Generate a descriptive commit message using conventional commit format (see Git Workflow in project instructions)
        * Create the specified branch if it doesn't exist (git checkout -b <branch-name>)
        * If the branch exists, switch to it (git checkout <branch-name>)
        * Stage all changes (git add .)
        * Commit with the generated message
        * Push to the specified branch (git push origin <branch-name>)
        * DO NOT commit to main or any other branch - ONLY use the user-provided branch name
      - Tools: runCommands, getTerminalOutput

   3. validate-step.prompt.md
      - Description: "Validate that all success criteria for the current step are met"
      - Mode: code-reviewer (AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES to code-reviewer mode)
      - Collects input: step-number (REQUIRED, e.g., "5-0", "5-1")
      - Instructions:
        * Use gh CLI to find the main exercise issue (see Workflow Utilities in project instructions)
        * Get the issue with comments
        * Search through the issue to find "# Step {step-number}:"
        * Extract the "Success Criteria" section from that step
        * Check each criterion against the current workspace state
        * Report completion status with specific guidance for any incomplete items
      - The step number is required
      - Tools: codebase, problems, runCommands, getTerminalOutput

   Mode specifications:
   - execute-step specifies mode: tdd-developer (auto-switches for execution context)
   - validate-step specifies mode: code-reviewer (auto-switches for review context)
   - commit-and-push does NOT specify a mode (works in any context)

   Format as .prompt.md files ready to save in .github/prompts/

   These prompts rely on the Workflow Utilities and Git Workflow sections in .github/copilot-instructions.md for gh CLI and Git knowledge.
   ```

3. Copilot will generate and create all three files:
   - `.github/prompts/execute-step.prompt.md`
   - `.github/prompts/commit-and-push.prompt.md`
   - `.github/prompts/validate-step.prompt.md`

4. **Key Learning**: This demonstrates BOTH prompt patterns:
   - **Auto-switching prompts** (`/execute-step`, `/validate-step`): Automatically select the right mode for their specific task
   - **Universal prompts** (`/commit-and-push`): Work in any mode because they're context-independent

   You'll use auto-switching for workflow stages (execution, validation) and universal prompts for utilities (commit)!

   **Note on Memory**: The AI automatically documents patterns and discoveries in `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` as it works - no separate prompt needed! The Memory System section in your project instructions tells AI to do this naturally.

5. The prompt slash commands will be available immediately. You can start using them right away!

### Understanding Mode Specification in Prompts

You just created three prompts with **different mode strategies**:

#### Pattern 1: Auto-Switching Prompts (Mode Specified)

**`/execute-step`** and **`/validate-step`**:

- **Specify a mode** in their YAML frontmatter
- **Automatically switch** to the appropriate mode when invoked
- **Why?**
  - `/execute-step` ‚Üí `tdd-developer`: Most step work involves iterative development using TDD principles - whether fixing existing tests (Step 5-1) or implementing features with TDD thinking (Step 5-3). The mode handles both scenarios.
  - `/validate-step` ‚Üí `code-reviewer`: Validation is ALWAYS a review task - checking criteria, analyzing state
- **Teaching**: The prompt knows the best context and switches automatically - reducing cognitive load

#### Pattern 2: Universal Utility Prompts (No Mode Specified)

**`/commit-and-push`**:

- Does NOT specify a mode in YAML frontmatter
- Works in whatever chat mode you're currently in
- **Why?** Git operations are context-independent - committing works the same whether you're in TDD mode, review mode, or any other mode
- **Teaching**: Some utilities are truly universal and don't need specialized context

#### When to Use Each Pattern?

**Specify MODE (Auto-Switch) when:**

- The task always needs the same specialized context
- You want to reduce cognitive load (no manual mode switching)
- The mode choice is obvious and unchanging
- Example: execution ‚Üí TDD, validation ‚Üí review

**Use NO MODE (Universal) when:**

- The task is context-independent
- It works the same way regardless of mode
- Multiple modes would provide identical behavior
- Example: Git operations, file management

**Key Insight**: This is the power of prompt files! Most prompts should be "smart" about context (auto-switch), but truly universal utilities don't need mode specification. You'll use auto-switching far more often!

---

### :keyboard: Activity: Test Your Workflow System (Optional)

Want to explore your new workflow system before moving forward? Try these:

1. **Test Chat Modes:**
   - Switch to `tdd-developer` mode and ask: `What's the first step in fixing a failing test?`
   - Switch to `code-reviewer` mode and ask: `How should I approach fixing multiple lint errors?`

2. **Test Prompt Auto-Switching:**
   - In ANY mode, type `/validate-step` and provide step number `5-0`
   - Watch it automatically switch to `code-reviewer` mode and check your success criteria!

> üí° **Skip this if you want**: The GitHub Actions workflow will validate everything automatically when you push. You'll know if anything is missing!

### :keyboard: Activity: Commit and Push Your Customizations

1. Now use the agentic workflow you just built! In Copilot Chat, type:

   ```text
   /commit-and-push
   ```

2. When prompted for the branch name, provide:

   ```text
   feature/agentic-workflow
   ```

3. Watch as Copilot (using project instructions):
   - Analyzes your changes with `git diff`
   - Generates a descriptive commit message
   - Creates and commits to the feature branch
   - Pushes to GitHub

4. **Wait for the workflow to complete** - GitHub Actions will post Step 5-1 instructions to this issue!

---

## What You Just Did

üéâ **You bootstrapped a complete agentic workflow system!**

You've set up the foundational infrastructure for **autonomous AI development**:

### Memory Layer

- **Project Instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`): AI can now access project documentation, patterns, and workflow principles across all conversations - this is the **persistent memory** that connects AI to your existing context from Sessions 2-4

### Agent Layer

- **TDD Developer Mode**: Specialized mode for Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Code Reviewer Mode**: Specialized mode for systematic code quality workflows
- **Workflow Utilities**: Shared gh CLI and Git knowledge available to all modes

### Interface Layer

- **Three Prompt Files**: User-friendly slash commands (`/execute-step`, `/commit-and-push`, `/validate-step`) that trigger autonomous workflows with simple commands

### The Bootstrap Pattern

You used **AI to build AI infrastructure** (`copilot-customization` ‚Üí everything else):

- **Memory System** (persistent + working) enables knowledge persistence and learning
- **Specialized Modes** (chat modes) focus on specific workflow stages (TDD, code review)
- **Shared Utilities** (gh CLI, Git workflows) available to all modes via project instructions
- **User Interfaces** (prompt files) provide accessible entry points

**You created infrastructure-as-code for AI workflows** - version controlled, shareable, and reusable across your team!

### Ready for Agentic Development

With this system bootstrapped, you're now ready to:

- **Step 5-1**: Use TDD Developer mode for Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Step 5-2**: Use Code Reviewer mode for systematic lint fixes
- **Step 5-3**: Use both modes for frontend implementation
- **Throughout**: Capture discoveries in working memory

The infrastructure you just created will support all of these workflows!

---

## Pro Tips for Real-World Usage

### When to Use Each Mode

Throughout Session 5 (and in your real projects), switch modes based on your task:

- **`tdd-developer`**: When applying TDD principles - whether writing tests first for new features, fixing failing tests, or implementing incrementally with test-driven thinking (even manual testing)
- **`code-reviewer`**: When addressing lint errors, refactoring, improving code quality
- **`copilot-customization`**: When creating more custom modes or instructions
- **Agent mode (no custom)**: When you need general help or a fresh perspective
- **All modes** have access to workflow utilities (gh CLI, Git workflows) from project instructions

### Team Collaboration

Since these are files in `.github/`, they're:

- **Version controlled**: Track changes, review updates
- **Shared automatically**: Everyone on the team gets the same AI context
- **Customizable per project**: Different standards for different codebases
- **Discoverable**: New team members instantly get AI assistance aligned with team practices

### Expanding Your Customization

After this session, consider creating:

- **More chat modes**: Security review, performance analysis, accessibility auditing
- **Instructions files**: Specific to file types (`.instructions.md` with `applyTo` patterns)
- **Prompt files**: Reusable prompts for common tasks (`.prompt.md`)
- **MCP integrations**: Connect to databases, APIs, custom tools

### Workflow Automation with Prompt Files

This repository includes **three powerful prompt files** that demonstrate agentic workflows:

#### `/execute-step` - Autonomous Step Execution

Run this prompt to have Copilot **read instructions from a GitHub Issue and execute them autonomously**:

1. Open Copilot Chat in Agent mode
2. Type `/execute-step` and press Enter
3. Provide the GitHub Issue URL when prompted
4. Watch as Copilot reads the instructions and executes each activity
5. Review the results and proceed to validation

**Why this matters**: This showcases how AI can follow documented procedures autonomously, a key pattern in DevOps and automation workflows.

#### `/commit-and-push` - Smart Git Workflow

Run this prompt to have Copilot **analyze your changes and push to your specified branch**:

1. After completing work on a step
2. Type `/commit-and-push` in Copilot Chat
3. When prompted, provide the branch name (e.g., "feature/agentic-workflow")
   - üí° **Important**: The prompt will **automatically create the branch** if it doesn't exist yet!
   - You don't need to run `git checkout -b` manually
4. Copilot will:
   - Check if the branch exists; create it if needed
   - Analyze your changes with `git diff`
   - Generate a meaningful commit message using conventional commit format
   - Stage all changes with `git add .`
   - Commit the changes to the specified branch
   - Push to GitHub (triggering the next step's workflow)

**Why this matters**: Demonstrates AI understanding of Git workflows, commit conventions, and branch strategies. The prompt handles the entire Git workflow for you!

#### `/validate-step` - Completion Verification

Run this prompt to **check if you've met all success criteria**:

1. When you think you've completed a step
2. Type `/validate-step` and provide the step number (e.g., "5-0")
3. Copilot will systematically check each criterion
4. Get a clear ‚úÖ/‚ùå report with specific guidance for any issues

**Why this matters**: Shows how AI can validate work against documented requirements, a crucial skill for CI/CD and quality assurance.

---

### üöÄ Try the Agentic Workflow (Optional Challenge)

**After creating your workflow automation mode and prompt files** (Activities 4 & 5), try completing this entire step using ONLY the slash commands:

1. **Read and execute**: `/execute-step` ‚Üí provide this issue's URL
2. **Validate completion**: `/validate-step` ‚Üí provide "5-0"
3. **Commit and push**: `/commit-and-push` ‚Üí provide "feature/agentic-workflow"
   - üí° The prompt will create this branch automatically if it doesn't exist!
4. **Wait for automation**: GitHub Actions posts Step 5-1 to this issue

This demonstrates **true agentic development** - AI autonomously following documented procedures with human oversight! ü§ñ

> **Note**: If you skipped Activities 4 & 5, that's fine! You can complete the step manually and explore workflow automation in later steps.

## Success Criteria

To complete this step successfully:

- ‚úÖ Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with workflow principles and doc links
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/memory/README.md` explaining the memory system
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/memory/session-notes.md` as historical session template
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` with pattern template
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/memory/scratch/` directory with `.gitignore` (for ephemeral files)
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md` template for active session notes
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/chatmodes/tdd-developer.chatmode.md`
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/chatmodes/code-reviewer.chatmode.md`
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/prompts/execute-step.prompt.md`
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/prompts/commit-and-push.prompt.md`
- ‚úÖ Created `.github/prompts/validate-step.prompt.md`
- ‚úÖ Committed and pushed all customizations (including `package-lock.json`) to `feature/agentic-workflow` branch
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions workflow automatically validates all required files and posts Step 5-1**

> üí° **Automated Validation**: You don't need to manually verify file creation! The Step 5-1 workflow will check for all required files and notify you if anything is missing. If Step 5-1 appears in this issue, everything passed! ‚ú®

## Key Takeaways

‚ú® **Agentic Architecture**: You built a multi-layered system (Memory ‚Üí Modes ‚Üí Prompts) where AI can work effectively within defined workflows

‚ú® **Persistent Memory**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` acts as AI's memory, connecting it to your existing documentation, workflow patterns, and utilities

‚ú® **Specialized Modes**: Different chat modes optimized for specific workflow stages (TDD cycles, code quality loops)

‚ú® **Shared Knowledge**: Workflow utilities (gh CLI, Git workflows) are available to all modes through project instructions - no duplication needed

‚ú® **Meta-Development**: You used AI (`copilot-customization`) to build AI tools - a key pattern in agentic development

## Next Steps

Now that Copilot understands your TODO app and you have specialized workflow modes, let's put them to work!

In **Step 5-1**, you'll use your **`tdd-developer`** mode to systematically fix failing backend tests through Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

**Ready?** Once you see Step 5-1 instructions posted to this issue, you're ready to start iterative test-driven development! üöÄ
