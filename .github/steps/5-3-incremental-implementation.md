# Step 5-3: Incremental Implementation

## Goal

Complete the frontend functionality using incremental feature implementation. Plan, build step-by-step, test continuously, and integrate with confidence using your custom chat modes.

## Background

The frontend is built with **Material-UI (MUI)** components and **React Query** for API state management, giving it a modern, professional look and feel. However, several features are incomplete or buggy:

- Delete functionality doesn't work (mutation not implemented)
- Edit functionality needs to be implemented
- Stats always show 0 (need to calculate from todos array)
- No empty state message when todos.length === 0
- API URL is hardcoded (should use relative URL)
- No error handling in React Query

**Tech Stack Used**:

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Modern React component library for UI
- **React Query**: Data fetching and state management for API calls
- **MUI Components**: Container, Card, TextField, Button, Checkbox, IconButton, Chip, etc.
- **React Query Hooks**: useQuery for fetching, useMutation for creating/updating/deleting

Your goal is to complete these features incrementally, testing each before moving to the next.

> **Continuing from Step 5-2**: You're still on the `feature/agentic-workflow` branch with all backend tests passing and lint errors fixed. Now, let's complete the frontend implementation incrementally, testing as we go.

## Instructions

> 🔄 **Fresh Start**: Before beginning, **start a new chat** (click the **+** button in Copilot Chat panel). This gives you a clean context for this step while still leveraging your project instructions and chat modes.

### :keyboard: Activity: Complete Frontend Implementation

> 💡 **How `/execute-step` works**: It reads the instructions from this GitHub Issue comment (including the Background section above that lists incomplete features), auto-switches to `tdd-developer` mode, and implements each feature incrementally. The documented requirements become the execution plan!

> 🧪 **TDD Approach for Frontend Features**: The AI should write **React Testing Library tests FIRST** for component logic (rendering, user interactions, state changes), then implement the features. This is true Test-Driven Development! The workflow:
>
> - **RED**: Write a React Testing Library test that fails (feature doesn't exist yet)
> - **GREEN**: Implement the feature to make the test pass
> - **REFACTOR**: Clean up the code while keeping tests green
> - **Verify manually**: Check it works in the browser (full integration)
>
> This is realistic! React Testing Library is the standard for testing React components. We skip e2e frameworks (Playwright, Cypress) to keep the lab focused on TDD principles without e2e complexity.

Use `/execute-step` to autonomously implement all frontend features:

1. **Run** `/execute-step` in Copilot Chat

2. **Watch the AI work!** It will:
   - Auto-switch to `tdd-developer` mode
   - Navigate to `packages/frontend/src/App.test.js` (or create it)
   - **Write React Testing Library tests FIRST** for each feature (RED phase):
     - Test delete functionality
     - Test stats calculation
     - Test empty state rendering
     - Test error handling
   - Watch tests fail (RED ✓)
   - Navigate to `packages/frontend/src/App.js`
   - Implement features to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
   - Refactor code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
   - Run lint to verify code quality

3. **Review the changes** it made in `packages/frontend/src/App.js`

4. **Test manually** in the browser:

   **Start both frontend and backend**:
   - In the terminal, run: `npm start` (from root directory)
   - This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) simultaneously
   - Wait for both to start (you'll see "Server running on port 3001" and "webpack compiled successfully")

   **Access the application**:
   - **Important**: When both servers start, you may only see one notification - often for port 3001 (the API)
   - **To access the frontend**: Click the **"Ports"** tab at the bottom of VS Code (next to the terminal tab)
   - Find port **3000** in the list (the frontend)
   - Click the **globe icon** (🌐) next to port 3000 to open in browser
   - You should see the TODO application in your browser

   > 💡 **Tip**: Port 3001 (backend) shows `Cannot GET /` if opened - that's expected! The backend is an API server, not a web app. Always use port 3000 for the frontend UI.

   **Test all features**:
   - Create new todos
   - Mark todos as complete
   - Delete todos (test the delete button)
   - Edit a todo and save
   - Verify stats update correctly (incomplete and completed counts)
   - Delete all todos to see empty state message

   **Test error handling**:
   - Stop the backend: Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal, then restart only frontend: `npm run start:frontend`
   - Refresh the browser - you should see error handling UI
   - Stop the frontend (`Ctrl+C`) when done testing

> 💡 **What's happening?** The AI uses incremental development: Plan → Build → Test → Fix for each feature, ensuring each works before moving to the next. It automatically documents patterns (React Query, MUI, error handling) to memory as it discovers them!

> 💡 **Pattern library**: AI naturally builds a library of frontend patterns that it can reference and apply in future development work - check `.github/memory/patterns-discovered.md` after this step!

### :keyboard: Activity: Validate and Progress

Now verify your work and push to trigger the next step:

1. **Validate completion** using `/validate-step`
   - Run: `/validate-step` in Copilot Chat
   - Provide step number: `5-3`
   - Checks that all features work
   - Verifies tests pass and no lint errors

2. **Commit and push** using `/commit-and-push`
   - Run: `/commit-and-push` in Copilot Chat
   - Provide branch: `feature/agentic-workflow`
   - AI analyzes changes and creates commit message
   - Pushes to trigger Step 5-4 workflow automatically

## Success Criteria

To complete this exercise successfully:

- ✅ Delete functionality works
- ✅ Stats show correct numbers (incomplete and completed counts)
- ✅ Empty state message displays when no todos
- ✅ Error handling provides user feedback
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)
- ✅ No lint errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Changes are committed and pushed to `feature/agentic-workflow` using `/commit-and-push`

## Key Workflow Patterns

✨ **Incremental Development**: Build features one at a time with continuous testing

✨ **Plan-Build-Test-Fix Cycle**: Break down features → implement → verify → debug → repeat

✨ **Continuous Testing**: Manual browser testing + automated tests catch issues early

✨ **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and user feedback improve UX

✨ **AI-Assisted Implementation**: Using `tdd-developer` mode for systematic feature building

✨ **Workflow Automation**: Using `/validate-step` and `/commit-and-push` prompts to progress through steps
